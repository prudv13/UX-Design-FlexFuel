# UX Design Prompt :

Design a user experience for flex fuel vehicles that is informative, easy to use, and encourages drivers to use more ethanol-blended fuels.

## Considerations:

- Educate drivers about the benefits of flex fuel vehicles and ethanol-blended fuels.
- Make it easy for drivers to find and use ethanol-blended fuels.
- Provide drivers with real-time information about their fuel consumption and emissions.
- Encourage drivers to use more ethanol-blended fuels by offering rewards or gamification features.

## Possible Solutions:

- Develop a mobile app that provides drivers with information about flex fuel vehicles and ethanol-blended fuels, as well as a map of nearby fueling stations that offer ethanol-blended fuels.
- Create a dashboard for flex fuel vehicles that provides drivers with real-time information about their fuel consumption and emissions, as well as the ethanol content of the fuel they are using.
- Offer drivers rewards for using more ethanol-blended fuels, such as discounts on fuel or points that can be redeemed for prizes.
- Gamify the use of ethanol-blended fuels by creating challenges or competitions for drivers, such as seeing who can use the most ethanol-blended fuel in a month.

## Additional Considerations:

- The user experience should be accessible to all drivers, regardless of their technical expertise.
- The user experience should be integrated with the vehicle's onboard computer system, so that drivers can easily access information about their fuel consumption and emissions.
- The user experience should be designed to encourage drivers to use more ethanol-blended fuels, without sacrificing performance or fuel economy.
